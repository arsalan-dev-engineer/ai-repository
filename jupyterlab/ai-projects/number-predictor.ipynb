    "Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "This project simulates a simple \"predictor\" that attempts to guess a secret number. The predictor starts with a wide range and gradually narrows down the possible numbers based on feedback from each guess. The feedback will indicate if each guess is \"too high\" or \"too low,\" helping the predictor zero in on the correct number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "* Generate a random number as the \"secret number.\"\n",
    "* The predictor makes an initial guess and stores each guess in a list.\n",
    "* Based on feedback (\"too high\" or \"too low\"), the predictor adjusts the guessing range.\n",
    "* The predictor continues adjusting until it finds the correct number\n",
